Music Exploration Game

The goal of this project is to create an interactive music experience

Original idea by unfa & Kass. (unless we're not first).

The initial goal is to create a simple 2D top-view maze-walking game with multiple paths to the exit. Along the way we'll place sound sources playing musical loops all in sync to naturally create crossfading musical textures evolving as the player/listener navigates the level.

The visuals and action should be kept very simple to not distract form the music.

The intention is for an interactive listening experience, not a game whre the music is cool   (that migth change later though)
